# Cplusplus-Program

---------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------

This program analyzes records of items sold throughout the day from open to close. The three things that are addressed in this program are:

1: Generating a list of all the items and their amounts that were purchased that day.

2: Generating a single item that was purchased from the users search.

3L Generating a histogram of all items with a * representing the amount that it was purchased.

This code contains both C++ and Python.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
---------------------------------------------------------

Where I think that I did exceptionally well in this program is C++ coding. I have really become fond of how this language is. While it is not mastery level

it is still something in this program that I think I did well. It is becoming easier as I continue to  write in C++. 


I think that I can enhance my code a little more by learning more about combing different languages together. In this program it was C++ and Python. While

these are still easy languages; it would benefit me to know how to combine these languages in a more proficient way.


---------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES
---------------------------------------------------------

Prior to this project I was struggling with how to get a .py file to talk to the .cpp. No matter what I did it seemed to only break further. I finally sat down

and made myself learn everything about how to make it work. This was going back through the material that was provided to us in the announcements.  This was truly

helpful as now I have these things saved in case I still need help in the future.


---------------------------------------------------------
TRANSFERABILITY AND READABLITIY
---------------------------------------------------------

The skill that I am going to transfer to other projects is communication between programs. When this is not necessary then opening and closing files. Both are

something that stuck with me as they are something that I struggled with, and it took me a few tries to get. However, after 3 projects it is very apparent

that these will be utilized in many projects to come.


I put notes in for every step of the way. Tried to eliminate any code that wasn't necessary for the program. This way it would be very easy for someone who did not know

the program could come in and easily follow the flow of what was going on.
